The Nations League is Europe‚Äôs continental soccer competition for men‚Äôs national teams. It is a relatively new contest that dates to 2018, and replaced international friendly matches that previously populated the calendar.

It is also the top in a four-league Nations League system that features promotion and relegation between the leagues. Winners in lower leagues are automatically promoted, while last place teams in the higher leagues are relegated down.
